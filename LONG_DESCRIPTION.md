## **Whatâ€™s the problem?**
>Too many solutions focus on solving the problem and not solving the root cause, why not solve both?
 
 *Scott Graham*

Almost 2 billion people ordered online last year which is astonishing. The energy information that is displayed to you when you shop online can be quite tedious or non-existent. Companies are not giving a simple enough explanation on their product's energy consumption rates or overall environment impact.

Some of the main issues with this problem:

* **Global pollution rised** due to long distance deliveries from online purchases.
* **Less energy efficient** products being ordered due to the information not being provided.
* **Local businesses losing profit** and customers to larger companies found online.

## **How TerraCare will Help?**

Using **IBM's Cloud Foundry**, **Cloudant**, **Delivery Pipelines** and **EPREL**(European Product Registry for Energy Labelling). We have designed a **Browser Plugin** that will help **simplify** product's energy information while creating **connections** between sustainable companies and conscious users.

The main goal is to:
* **Help** better understand the **User** on how damaging some products are for the planet. 
* **Simplify energy consumption information** on online products. 
* Suggest **alternative**, energy efficient products. 
* **Create a network** with smaller and local, eco-aware businesses.
* **Provide insights** about savings derived from more power efficient appliances and behaviours.
* Provide a **scoring system** for the User to display how **energy efficient** they shops have been creating awareness on their impact.

### **How does it work?** 

The plugin itself would only activate when browsing on an online product page. When visiting these pages, you will be prompted with a clear and simplified overview of the main energy informations and a lists of less impactful alternative products.

Thanks to **IBM Watson** our extension will be capable of defining the best **product alternatives**. Looking at similar products, with a smaller carbon footprint and impact, using informations such as **production location** and **energy consumptions rate**.

### **How would we simplify the information?** 

**TerraCare** would grab the energy information on products and display it in ways easier to read by providing:

* **Energy bill prices** compared to more energy efficient product's energy bill prices 
* The product's **energy consumption** in formats easier to comprehend 
* **Scoring system** to show how much the user is helping the planet (TerraScore)
* TerraPoints can be **converted** to obtain discounts and coupons to be used to buy sustainable products from **eco-aware companies**.

>We would constantly be thinking up ways on how to better help the User to understand their carbon footprint and impact to the planet.

## **Summary** 

**One shopper**'s carbon footprint may not have much of an impact on the **Planet**, but millions can.

 We believe that energy information is not being simplified as much as it should be contributing largely to global warming and environment pollution. We also believe in a lack of awareness about individual environment footprints and impact, which directly leads to the stasis of action on a personal basis.

**TerraCare** has the potential to be a large cog for a solution towards this problem, helping encouraging and enticing Users to be more energy efficient by educating and rewarding them.

TerraCare is brought to you by a team of 5 1st year Software development BSc students from the [University of the Highlands and Islands.](https://www.uhi.ac.uk/en/courses/bsc-hons-applied-software-development/)
