## Whatâ€™s the problem?

Almost 2 billion people ordered online last year which is astonishing. The energy information that is displayed to you when you shop online can be quite tedious or non-existent. Customers are not giving a simple enough explanation on their product's energy consumption rates.

Some of the main issues with this problem:

* Global warming alarmingly rising due to long distance deliveries from online purchases.
* Less energy efficient products being ordered due to the information not being provided.
* Local businesses losing profit and customers to larger companies found online.

## How TerraCare will Help?

Using IBM's Cloud Foundry, Cloudant, Delivery Pipeline and EPREL. We have designed a browser plugin that will help simplify product's energy information.

The main goal is to:
* Help better understand the user on how damaging some products are for the planet. 
* Simplify energy consumption information on online products. 
* Suggest alternative, energy efficient products. 
* Create a network with smaller and more local businesses.
* Provide a scoring system for the user to display how energy efficient they shops have been.

### How does it work? 

The plugin itself would only activate when browsing on an online product page. When visiting these pages, you will be prompted with lists of alternative products. These are found using a database containing tables full of appliances with all the relevant product information.

### How would we simplify the information? 

TerraCare would grab the energy information on products and display it in ways easier to read by providing:

* Energy bill prices compared to more energy efficient product's energy bill prices 
* The product's energy consumption in formats easier to comprehend 
* Scoring system to show how much the user is helping the planet (TerraScore) 

We would constantly be thinking up ways on how to better help the user to understand their carbon footprint and impact to the planet.

## Summary 

One shopper's carbon footprint may not have much of an impact on the planet, but millions can. We believe that energy information is not being simplified as much as it should be, contributing largely to global warming. 

TerraCare has the potential to be a large cog for a solution towards this problem. TerraCare will help encourage and entice users to be more energy efficient by educating and rewarding them.

TerraCare is brought to you by a team of 5 1st year software development BSc students from the University of the Highlands and Islands.
