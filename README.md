## Short description
Eco alternatives on the fly, **save the Environment from your screen.**


### **The idea**
>*â€œAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic".*
Clarke's three laws

Using Data from:
 * **EPREL**, the European Product Registry for Energy Labelling. 
* **Producer** and buyer locations to calculate travel distance.
* Informations about the products and its **production processes**. 

But mostly: thanks to **IBM Watson ML and IBM Services**. We will be able to develop a **Machine Learning model** capable of finding alternative and more sustainable, products, served to the Users via a **simple browser extension.**
