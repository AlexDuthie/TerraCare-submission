### Journey Planner

#### Plot Route and check weather

- You put in your start and end location and how you plan on travelling. The app then plots the route you will take and checks along the route every few miles for the weather conditions predicted on your journey.

- It could tell you about what you may need to be prepared for the weather or if it recommends travel.
